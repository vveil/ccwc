# CCWC

This is my own implementation of the command `wc` built with swift.

To use this clone the repo and call `swift build -c release` and then you can call the binary. Currently implemented flags are `-l -w -c -m`. Instead of specifying a file you can also pipe `|` the output of another command into it.
